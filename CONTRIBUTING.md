# CONTRIBUTING

Thanks for your enthusiasm to contribute to this project! Before doing so, please read the following steps how to contribute:


## Discuss the changes before doing them
 - First, open an issue in the repository using the [bug tracker][1], describing the contribution you would like to make, the bug you found or any other ideas you have. This will help us to get into the same page.

 - If possible, please add platform and software information (e.g. operating system, Node.JS version etc.), screenshots, or replication of your code.

 - Please wait for feedback before continuing to next steps.

## Fixing issues
 - Fork the project in your account and create a branch with your fix:
   `some-great-feature` or `some-issue-fix`.

 - Commit your changes in that branch. If the project contains tests (generally, the `test`
   directory), you are encouraged to add a test as well.

 - If the project contains a `package.json` or a `bower.json` file add yourself
   in the `contributors` array (or `authors` in the case of `bower.json`;
   if the array does not exist, create it):

   ```json
   {
      "contributors": [
         "Your Name <and@email.address> (http://your.website)"
      ]
   }
   ```

## Creating a pull request

 - Open a pull request, and reference the initial issue in the pull request
   message (e.g. *fixes #<your-issue-number>*). Write a good description and
   title, so everybody will know what is fixed/improved.

## Wait for feedback

Before accepting your contributions, we will review them. You may get feedback
about what should be fixed in your modified code. If so, just keep committing
in your branch and the pull request will be updated automatically.

## Everyone is happy!

Finally, your contributions will be merged, and everyone will be happy!
Contributions are more than welcome!

Thanks!
